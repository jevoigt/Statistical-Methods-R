# Statistical-Methods-R
Statistical Methods and Models with R Code and write ups.

This repository includes files across various assignments / projects within the Rstudio environment. 

Any csv, excel or txt files that are read into these scripts can be found in the Datasets repository.

These files are different scripts that display experience with statistical modeling and other statistical methods using differnt types of real world data from 
different sources. These files display knowledge within statistical modeling in regards to gathering insights and conclusions from different methods of hypoethesis
tests, confidence intervals, regression models, etc.

Much of this code was not originally intended to be provided for and/or used by anyone but myself or a professor, so please excuse any apparent lack of readability within chunks of code, or possible work flow confusions. The restructuring of my files is a work in progress to improve my work so it can become more interpretable to anyone who would like to view these files. The inclusion of other files and projects is ongoing.
